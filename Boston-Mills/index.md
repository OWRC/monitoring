# Background

A borehole was drilled and a well installed at this location in 2006 as part of investigations studying buried bedrock valley aquifer systems in southern Ontario (Figure 1; Davies et al., 2008).  Seismic geophysical surveys helped to situate this well close to the thalweg of the Caledon East buried bedrock valley.  The Caledon East buried bedrock valley which is believed to be a tributary or re-entrant channel trending roughly west-east into the main Laurentian bedrock valley system situated between Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario (Figure 2 and Figure 3).  Details regarding the sediment stratigraphy within the main Laurentian and tributary valleys and groundwater movement within these features remain sketchy despite the valley having been known for over 100 years (Spencer, 1881; 1890).

The Boston Mills monitoring well is screened within a 20m thick sand and gravel unit (150 to 171 mbgs) situated above shale bedrock.  The interpreted thickness and extent of this basal aquifer (shown as the Scarborough aquifer complex) is illustrated on Figure 5 and Figure 6.
